# My Work so far...
Here I present some of my best projects, the topics may vary from data science all the way to data structrures and algorithms.
Enjoy!

## 3NCRYPT0R <a name="en3ncrypt0r"></a>
3NCRYPT0R is a **terminal-based** program designed for UNIX systems. 
3NCRYPT0R´s job is to encrypt files with a special and unique key obtained from hashing a keyword provided while using the program.
This way all your files/folders would be completely secured and encrypted.
3NCRYPT0R also comes with a decrypt option, in case you need to decrypt your previously encrypted files. To decrypt said files you will be requiered to use the unique key provided during the encryption phase.
3NCRYPT0R is able to encrypt both files and folders!

## Oscars 2023 data analysis using Natural Language Processing <a name="oscars"></a>
This data science based project consists of analysing Tweets regarding the Oscars 2023 ceremony. 
To analyse said data it was requiered to use Python (Jupyter notebook) and the Tweepy library.
This project is basically a NLP *(Natural language processing)* data analysis of each and every tweet.
During this analysis a lot of interesting data was discovered, for example. One of the most common topics on each tweet was the announcement of Jimmi Kimmel as the host, as well as Tom Cruise´s Top Gun: Maverick


## Guessing game GUI in Java using binary trees <a name="guessingGame"></a>
This project was made in java using JavaFX for the GUI. It basically consists on a Guessing game, where the program will try to guess the animal that you are currently thinking about.
This behaviour is not entirely IA, but instead is obtained by using a data structure called binary tree. More specifically a binary search tree.
Where each leave contains the name of an animal. The code uses the user´s yes/no answers in order to traverse the tree and find an answer.
In case no answer is found the program will prompt an appropiate message; likewise if the answer is found it will be prompted to the user with the name of such animal.
